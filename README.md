# A SAMPLE TECH WEBPAGE

## Overview
This is a page made using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript to create a sample responsive webpage
I am not a professional so my code may not be concise however, if you have any additions or contributions, feel free to do so. I am hoping to add more pages as time goes on

##Experience
This was a tough one. I used and copied many youtube videos and articles to understand and implement new concepts like effectively using media queries and line gradients in CSS thus making this project the one with the longest CSS code. It took me approximately 12 hours.
